# Passive-Balancing
Passive balancing is a method of balancing the cells by dissipating the charge in the form of heat from the cell. 
..

This modelling was inpsired by one of the students who had modelled 3s-1p , for better understanding i slightly changed the model to 4s-1p by adding few blocks and 
considering an extra pack .
The motive of the project is to passively balance the batteries depending on their SOC(State of Charge). 
I have considered 4 battery packs, all the 4 batteries have different lower limits of SOC. When we generate the graph, we can clearly see the balancing of batteries. 

In this particular example , you can change the parameters like SOC(Lower and upper limits), Current levels , Voltage levels to better understand how the system works.

The battery  estimated values have been taken from internet.
I hope it helps .
